## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I Learned

This project helped me practice building a responsive card component using HTML and CSS. I learned how to use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

Here is an example of a media query I used:

```css
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 75%;
  }

  .qr-text h2 {
    padding: 1rem 0.5rem;
    font-weight: 400;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving my CSS skills, especially with flexbox and grid.
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Exploring advanced responsive design techniques.

### Useful Resources
